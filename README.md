Snowplow is a scalable open-source platform for rich, high quality, low-latency data collection. It is designed to collect high quality, complete behavioral data for enterprise business.

**To find out more, please check out the [Snowplow website][website] and our [documentation][docs].**

## Snowplow C++ Tracker Overview

Snowplow C++ tracker enables you to add analytics to your C++ applications, servers and games when using a [Snowplow][snowplow] pipeline.

## Quick Start

The tracker supports macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Installation

There are two ways to install the tracker in your app:

1. By including the project using cmake.
2. By copying source files inside the `include` folder into your codebase.

#### Using cmake

Cmake version 3.14 or greater is required. You may add the library to your project target (`your-target`) using `FetchContent` like so:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    snowplow
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-cpp-tracker
    GIT_TAG        1.0.0
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(snowplow)
target_link_libraries(your-target snowplow)
```

#### Copying files to your project

Download the most recent release from the [releases section](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-cpp-tracker/releases). Everything in the `include` folders will need to be included in your application.

The project has two dependencies that need to be included in your project: [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) and [the amalgamated version of sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html). You will need to update the include paths in headers `include/snowplow/thirdparty/json.hpp` and `include/snowplow/thirdparty/sqlite3.hpp`.

#### Additional requirements under Linux

The following libraries need to be installed:

* curl (using `apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev` on Ubuntu)
* uuid (using `apt install uuid-dev` on Ubuntu)

### Using the tracker

Import using the `snowplow/snowplow.hpp` header file and initialize the tracker with your Snowplow collector endpoint and tracker configuration:

```cpp
#include "snowplow/snowplow.hpp"

using namespace snowplow;

// Initialize tracker with namespace, collector URI, HTTP method, and SQLite database path (see docs for other options)
auto tracker = Snowplow::create_tracker("ns", "https://collector.com", POST, "sp.db");
```

Track custom events (see the documentation for the full list of supported event types):

```cpp
// structured event
StructuredEvent se("category", "action");
tracker->track(se);

// screen view event
ScreenViewEvent sve;
string name = "Screen ID - 5asd56";
sve.name = &name;
tracker->track(sve);
```

Check the tracked events in a [Snowplow Micro](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/what-is-snowplow-micro/) or [Snowplow Mini](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/what-is-snowplow-mini/) instance.

## Maintainer Quick Start

### Building on macOS and Linux

```bash
 host> git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-cpp-tracker
 host> cd snowplow-cpp-tracker
 host> cmake -D SNOWPLOW_BUILD_TESTS=1 -D SNOWPLOW_BUILD_EXAMPLE=1 -B build .
 host> cd build
 host> make
```

This will create two executables - the first is the test suite. To run the test suite, first start a [Snowplow Micro](https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/snowplow-micro) instance and run:

```bash
 host> ./snowplow-tests
```

The other is an example program which will send one of every type of event to an endpoint of your choosing like so:

```bash
 host> ./snowplow-example {{ your collector uri }}
```

If you make changes only to a header file there is a chance it won't be picked up by make in which case you will need to:

```bash
 host> make clean
 host> make
```

#### Performance testing

The project also provides performance tests to measure changes in performance of the tracker. The tests measure performance under a few scenarios in which they vary the emitter and session.

Build and run the performance using the following steps from the root of the project:

```bash
 host> cmake -D SNOWPLOW_BUILD_PERFORMANCE=1 -B build .
 host> cd build && make && cd ..
 host> ./build/snowplow-performance
```

To compare with historical performance measurements (logged in the `performance/logs.txt` file), run the following Python script that will output a table with the performance comparison:

```bash
 host> ./performance/stats.py                                       

 Metric                                | Max     | Min     | Mean    | Last    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 mocked emitter and mocked session     | 5.27s   | 5.08s   | 5.18s   | 5.27s   |
 mocked emitter and real session       | 5.08s   | 5.04s   | 5.06s   | 5.07s   |
 mute emitter and mocked session       | 18.77s  | 17.29s  | 18.08s  | 18.77s  |
 mute emitter and real session         | 28.02s  | 22.61s  | 25.06s  | 22.61s  |
```

### Building on Windows

 ```git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-cpp-tracker```

In the cloned directory two [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) project files are available:

* `snowplow-cpp-tracker.sln`
    This is required to compile the tracker and run the tests (you'll need this one to edit the tracker itself)
* `snowplow-cpp-tracker-example.sln`
    This is a demo project showing use of this tracker

To run the tests under windows, you need to open the `snowplow-cpp-tracker.sln` solution, build it for your target platform *and run the resulting executable*.
