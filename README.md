## Overview

Snowplow event tracker for C++. Add analytics to your C++ applications, servers and games

## Developer Quickstart

### Building on Mac OSX

```bash
 host> git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-cpp-tracker
 host> cd snowplow-cpp-tracker
 host> make
```

This will create two executables - the first is the test-suite which can be executed with `make unit-tests`.

The other is an example program which will send one of every type of event to an endpoint of your choosing like so:

```bash
 host> cd build
 host> ./tracker_example {{ your collector uri }}
```

If you make changes only to a header file there is a chance it won't be picked up by make in which case you will need to:

```bash
 host> make clean
 host> make
```

To run the test suite:

```bash
 host> make unit-tests
```

If you wish to generate a local code coverage report you will first need to install [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) on your host machine.  The easiest way to do this is using [brew](http://brew.sh/):

```bash
 host> brew install lcov 
```

Then run the following:

```bash
 host> make lcov-genhtml
```

The above runs the test suite and then generates a full code coverage report which can be accessed by opening the `index.html` in the `build` directory.

### Building on Windows

 ```git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-cpp-tracker```

In the cloned directory two [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) project files are available:

* `snowplow-cpp-tracker.sln`
    This is required to compile the tracker and run the tests (you'll need this one to edit the tracker itself)
* `snowplow-cpp-tracker-example.sln`
    This is a demo project showing use of this tracker

To run the tests under windows, you need to open the `snowplow-cpp-tracker.sln` solution, build it for your target platform *and run the resulting executable*.
