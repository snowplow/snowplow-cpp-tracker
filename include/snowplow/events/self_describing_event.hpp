 * @brief Event to track custom information that does not fit into the out-of-the box events.
 *
 * Self-describing events are a [data structure based on JSON Schemas](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/understanding-tracking-design/understanding-schemas-and-validation/)
 * and can have arbitrarily many fields.
 * To define your own custom self-describing event, you must create a JSON schema for that
 * event and upload it to an [Iglu Schema Repository](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu) using
 * [igluctl](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/open-source-components-and-applications/iglu/)
 * (or if a Snowplow BDP customer, you can use the
 * [Snowplow BDP Console UI](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/understanding-tracking-design/managing-data-structures/)
 * or [Data Structures API](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/understanding-tracking-design/managing-data-structures-via-the-api-2/)).
 * Snowplow uses the schema to validate that the JSON containing the event properties is well-formed.
